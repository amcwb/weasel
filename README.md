# Weasel
A simple universal backend for making multiplayer games.

This is still in development, and proper documentation is not yet created. Feel
free to contribute!

## Setup

To install the required dependencies, and have `yarn` installed, run:

```sh
yarn
```

If you use solely NPM, run:

```sh
npm i
```

## Executing

To run the backend, do the following if you use yarn: 

```sh
yarn start
```

Or the following for npm:

```sh
npm run start
```

This builds the typescript code to `dist/` and runs it. There are several scripts in `package.json` to build and run linters.
